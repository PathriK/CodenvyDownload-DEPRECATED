# CodenvyDownload

There is a online (cloud) IDE with which users can work on various languages including Android. 

But to test the APK in a real device is a pain as the APK needs to be manually downloaded and installed in a Mobile device. The following application is to ease this process.

This App can be used to trigger remote build and download the project artifact (An android application APK) and trigger installation of downloaded APK in the device.

**Usage:**

1. Go to Setup
2. Login using Codenvy Credentials
3. Select the Workspace & Project for which APK needs to be downloaded
4. Go back
5. Click on 'Build Download & Install'
6. The Project gets build and the generated APK gets downloaded and installed automatically
